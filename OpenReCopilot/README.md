## OpenReCopilot

We attempted to reverse the protected code using **Pyarmor-Static-Unpack-1shot**, which enabled partial recovery of low-level assembly. The `cdc` directory contains artifacts from CDC decompilation, though the output quality was poor. I later reprocessed parts of the Bytecode using **Gemini**, which yielded better results, but key segments remain unrecovered. Therefore, the project remains non-functional at this stage.
